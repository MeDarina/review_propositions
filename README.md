This is a manually annotated proposition dataset from sentences taken from restaurant reviews (ABSA 2014; see http://metashare.dfki.de/repository/browse/semeval-2014-absa-restaurant-reviews-train-data/479d18c0625011e38685842b2b6a04d72cb57ba6c07743b9879d1a04e72185b8/)  that distinguishes between clauses that need to be split and those that do not. 
The corpus allowed us to independently compare the performance of proposition extraction systems on simple and complex clauses. The analysis can be found in the corresponding paper.
